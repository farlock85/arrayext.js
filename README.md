# Array Extensions for TypeScript

Curray adds extra functionality to the native JavaScript Array type without the added overhead of an expensive library.

This package is based on the library [linqts](https://github.com/kutyel/linq.ts).

## Install

Install the Curray package through NPM:

```sh
npm i --save curray
```

Alternatively you can download the package from the Releases page.

## Usage

Because this library has no imports you will need to manually include the file in your webpack, Angular or header of your site.

## Tests

Execute this command to run tests:

```sh
npm run tests
```
