# Array Extensions for TypeScript

ArrayExtJS is a linq inspired extension library for JavaScript. It exposes most of the functions you can find in linq in a lightweight, performant version in JavaScript.

This package is based on the library [linqts](https://github.com/kutyel/linq.ts).

## Install

Install the ArrayExtJS package through NPM:

```sh
npm i --save arrayextjs
```

Alternatively you can download the package from the Releases page.

## Usage

Because this library has no imports you will need to manually include the file in your webpack, Angular or header of your site.

## Tests

Execute this command to run tests:

```sh
npm run tests
```
